 - O outrun cpu sync optim.
 - X run vaporous neogeo demo + neogeo3d.

 big round of "let's make it better on native AGA and OCS".

todo R1.2

 Now I test with a Rpi CM4 with no overclock (1.5Ghz).


 - Added such excellent games as Caveman Ninja, Cliffhanger Edward Randy,Robocop 2, and Mutant fighter (machine deco16)
 - Few optimisations for chasehq/sci/operation thunderblot/nightstriker (+12% speed),topspeed,CPS2 games (late street fighters).
 - The Abyss "Cruisin5" demo emulation using the arkanoid hardware,
    now support "sprite multiplexing" so the demo is much, much more enjoyable.( There are still a few glitch left).

 Corrections:
 - X wrong colors on shadows: Dynamite Dux, golden Axe -> corrected.
 - X Outzone "black screen": repaired.
 - X Salamander corrupted sprite: corrected.
 - X topspeed (taito outrun clone): corrected, few glitch left.
 - X neogeo sound mixer simplified, may accelerate a bit on rPi3.
 - X zoom909 wrong colors: corrected (palette rom is wrong, luckily could re-use parent palette.)

 Improvments:
 - Operation thunderbolt display crosshair only if moves. Remember you can play with 2 players with 2 mouses.
   Now the second mouse button in window mode is trapped (does not open menu when window is focus),
   also second mouse button was not automatically selected as "second button" like for joystick.
   This is now the default when selecting mouse for inputs and needed for operation thunderbolt bombs.

 Preferences evolutions:
 - Frameskip is now a preference "Per game".
 - A P96driver update trashed my screen configurations creating "ghost 0000 screenmodes" with wrong pixel mode.
    Use new option "Force Depth 16" in such case, or select a 32bit mode explicitly to bypass problems.
 - A Misc option for patch "NewLowLevel" needed by some A2000 configuration.

------------------------------------------- still todo

 - X mortal kombat/NBAJam boot !!
 - O corrected amigaguide with OS3.2 version that includes images.

 - O "Carrier Air Wing has graphic corruptions in first level (cawing)"
        "No matter which set, has graphic corruption in the first level."
        "After some enemies move from the background to the foreground, the entire game freezes."
 - O Bubble Bobble 2


  since beta4:
 - A large Amigaguide documentation with tons of tricks for better usage !
 - lots of early 80 games added, also some early konami and atari games:
  pacman,galaga,pengo,qbert,donkey kong (&jr),green beret,pingpong,gyruss,gradius, gauntlet1&2,klax,....
 - extra sound samples archive in dir samples/ are now supported so q*bert can say things like "@!#?@!".
 - switching fullscreen to window with F10 now remember window's size and position, and this is saved by resolution. This gives a high comfort.
 - 8Bit 256 colors screen and AGA workbenchs window mode can now display any source color format (8bit,16b,32bit) through color remap. Anything can be displayed by anywhat with rotation support and all.
 - ThunderForceAC repaired, psychic5 (and 32b tilemaps) was broken+ bugs in DrawScaleXXX() that could hit memory.

 Done from Beta 1 to Beta 2:
  - Corrected a bug on joystick config SetJoyPortAttrs(): missing the final TAG_DONE.
     What a silly mistake: It is not tagged "Beta" for nothing.
	 This actually was prone to freeze game initialisation. -> CORRECTED

  - Default color Gamma is now 1.0 and not 0.5, .. i've been told it was too dark,
    + gamma and brightness available in configuration
  - Cheat mode file explicit in configuration.
  - Operation thunderbolt and games with flags ORIENTATION_FLIP_X or ORIENTATION_FLIP_Y
		are now displayed the right way (hopefully, no flipY games works).

  - X Implement CGX/ScalePixelArray() for drawing


 For beta 2 in term of priorities :


  - O optimise memory write/read calls for z80/68k
  - X Implement CGX/ScalePixelArray() for drawing
  - X Implement Triple buffer (with ChangeScreen or else ?)
  - O implement WriteChunkyPixels instead of WPA8 when os>=3.1
  - O try to optimise sound chips with ridiculously high timing & cpu use (YM2151 ?)

  Games not working when should:
  - X neogeo ? -> investigate init error   -> OK
  - X arkanoid 1 -> investigate init error  ->OK
  - X all rtypes ? -> am I using wrong roms ? ->OK

 - - - - -
 - X ui: want number of players per games so much.
 - X frameskip -> simple ->No
 - X do save screenshot -> who care ? -> no.

 - X a rom load progress bar somewhere.

 -  command line
    - O have most of the regular mame command options to list available roms.
	- X lancer rom direct avec ligne commande ou tooltip.

 - O test memory leaks and hits with muGuardianAngel & else -> muGuardianAngel with UAE & OS3.2 does nothing ????
 - X verif GetCatalogStr , -> REMOVE ugly locale/catcomp engine that looks like leaking (no close calls ?), reintegrate later maybe.
