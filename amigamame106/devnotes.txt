todo beta3c
- O keyboard blocked keys bug
- O wrong megatech colors
- X main.cfg trashed when caching big romset.
- X 6% to 8% gain of 68k optimisations
- O manage freeze init pass


 Todo for beta3:
 - X Mouse twice faster
 - X bug when reloading list

  - X- implement triple buffer at intuition level
  - X mouse as optional input for analog input -> play arkanoid with mouse
     X - idealy could have mouse+joy for same player
     X - could have 2 mouses for 2 players (arkanoid return ?).
  - O try to reactivate 8bit window remap.
  - X no sound buzing when moving windows
  - O remember windows position and size per resolution.


 Done from Beta 1 to Beta 2:
  - Corrected a bug on joystick config SetJoyPortAttrs(): missing the final TAG_DONE.
     What a silly mistake: It is not tagged "Beta" for nothing.
	 This actually was prone to freeze game initialisation. -> CORRECTED

  - Default color Gamma is now 1.0 and not 0.5, .. i've been told it was too dark,
    + gamma and brightness available in configuration
  - Cheat mode file explicit in configuration.
  - Operation thunderbolt and games with flags ORIENTATION_FLIP_X or ORIENTATION_FLIP_Y
		are now displayed the right way (hopefully, no flipY games works).

  - X Implement CGX/ScalePixelArray() for drawing


 For beta 2 in term of priorities :


  - O optimise memory write/read calls for z80/68k
  - O Implement CGX/ScalePixelArray() for drawing
  - O Implement Triple buffer (with ChangeScreen or else ?)
  - O implement WriteChunkyPixels instead of WPA8 when os>=3.1
  - O try to optimise sound chips with ridiculously high timing & cpu use (YM2151 ?)

  Games not working when should:
  - X neogeo ? -> investigate init error   -> OK
  - X arkanoid 1 -> investigate init error  ->OK
  - X all rtypes ? -> am I using wrong roms ? ->OK

 - - - - -
 - O ui: want number of players per games so much.
 - O frameskip -> simple ->No
 - O do save screenshot -> who care ?

 - O remove S-TV , too much non working drivers.
 - O mui list avoir annÃ©e et entreprise en colonne
 - O mui list: have a column for nb players -> where to get that ?
 - O allow sorting by columns
 - O finish drawing leds, test with a driver that lag while booting if it helps
 - O a rom load progress bar somewhere.

 -  command line
    - O have most of the regular mame command options to list available roms.
	- X lancer rom direct avec ligne commande ou tooltip.

 - O test memory leaks and hits with muGuardianAngel & else -> muGuardianAngel with UAE & OS3.2 does nothing ????
 - O verif GetCatalogStr , -> REMOVE ugly locale/catcomp engine that looks like leaking (no close calls ?), reintegrate later maybe.
